# librato-iOS Demo

This simple but direct project showcases some simple uses of the `librato-iOS` library.

# Usage

Because this demo project uses the `podspec` in the main library you'll need to grab the entire repo.

* Clone the `librato-iOS` repo (`$ git clone git@github.com:amco/librato-iOS.git`)
* Navigate into the Demo directory and install the Pods (`cd librato-iOS/Demo && pod install`)
* Open the workspace (`open librato-iOS\ Demo.xcworkspace`)
* Open `LibratoDemoAppDelegate.m` to select which demos to run
* Open `LibratoDemoEventTracker.m` to see how each demo is created
